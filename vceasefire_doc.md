# Venture Capital Community Statement of Support for Palestine

Over the last month, unfortunately, the venture capital community has been represented by firms, LPs, GPs who all stand with Israel in their recent onslaught of Gaza commiting many atrocities & crimes against humanity, including, but not limited to:
- Bombings of hospitals
- Bombings of houses of worship (Churches & Mosques)
- Shooting at civilians waving white flags (including when attempting to leave hospitals)
- Indiscriminate bombings in civilian areas including Schools - causing the deaths of many hostages.
- Use of chemical weapons (white phosphorous)
- Ethnic Cleansing
- Dehumanization
- Use of weapons which are solely designed to mince everyone in it's path
- Cutting off power, water, aid & telecommunications
- The use of starvation & dehydration as a weapon
- Acceleration of racist, fascist and Apartheid policies
- Killing civilians in Lebanon & threatening to bomb Beirut
- Attempting to cynically leverage the disgraceful history of European fascism, Nazism & the atrocity of the Holocaust in an attempt to justify Israeli extermination of Palestinians

The Israeli occupation has been an enduring partner to the global repression and weapons ecosystem, fostering groundbreaking technological advancements and cyberweapon innovation that are used by dictators to repress their own citizens, kill journalists & arm beligerents in other regions (for example arming Azerbaijan). The occupations's contribution to the world in terms of weapons technology, cyberweapons research, and anti-democratic tools industry is unmistakable, and we hold deep contempt for its unwavering commitment to repression all over the world.

The recent genocidal campaign of extermination in Gaza have been truly heart-wrenching, as we bear witness to the devastation they've wrought and the 5000+ innocent childrens' lives they've tragically claimed. It is our hope that we stand together for a ceasefire which will allow all hostages from both sides to be safely returned - around 230 Israeli hostages & 10,000+ Palestinian hostages of administrative detention - enabling peace talks to continue working towards an end of the illegal occupation, an end of apartheid, and a Free Palestine. All of which are vital steps in shaping a better future for all.
